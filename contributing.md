### Feature branches
* These are used to create a new feature
* Use the name of the feature to as the branch name with `feature-` prefix
* Once a feature is finished the branch should be deleted

## Pull requests
* When a feature is ready or a milestone has been reached, a pull request can be made
* The pull request is from a branch into the development branch
* At least 2 code reviewers are required before merging can be completed

## Commits

* After the prefix `add` or `fix` there is a short(~10 words)descriptive message about the commit
